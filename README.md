TaylorsSeries
====

#### Summary

Generates an estimated sin using a taylor series

#### Definition

According to Wikipedia the defintion is :
>where n! denotes the factorial of n and f(n)(a) denotes the nth derivative of f evaluated at the point a. The derivative of order zero of f is defined to be f itself and (x âˆ’ a)0 and 0! are both defined to be 1. When a = 0, the series is also called a Maclaurin series.

### My Equation

I figured that my series only has to be acurate between the range of -2PI and 2PI. The most accurate i could get it was up to 21.
